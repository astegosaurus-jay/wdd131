            <h2>A Time Capsule to Childhood</h2>
            <p>The one thing I really remember from when I was really little was that I ate, breathed, sleeped Pokemon. I was a little kid during the hayday of pokemaina, I remember that I didn't know the days of the week but I knew what day it was to wake up and watch Pokemon. I still love Pokemon to this day, and now as a grupmy old man I have my critisims with it but those memories of opening packs and getting cards as a kid has stuck with me to this day. Its sad to me how much this trading card game has turned from a product for kids to essentially a stock market where its something to invest in because its valuable. This even affected my enjoyment where over the last few years I would really only be happy if I pulled valueable cards even though I never planned on selling them. I have taken a break from buting packs for a while now and when I eventually start again I want to jsut simply enjoy the experience and appreciate them for what they are. This is just a small amount of pictures from my collection, but its fun to look back and just feel some of that excitment I had when I was a kid. </p>
